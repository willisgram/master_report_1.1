The scope of this thesis has been determined by the authors of the project along with their supervisors Magnus St\aa lhane, Xin Wang and Giovanni Pantuso. The object is to create an optimization model of the Fantasy Sports, Fantasy Premier League. In order to do so, predictions of the real Premier League players' expected performance is provided. The work that has been done on this rather unfamiliar field of area is presented.

We want to thank our supervisors, Magnus St\aa lhane, Xin Wang and Giovanni Pantuso. Their guidance have been valuable in the creating of this report. Without their quick and thorough feedback,  this report would not have been a reality. Additionally, we want to thank Sportradar for providing us with sophisticated data used in this thesis.
