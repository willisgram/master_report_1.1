\chapter{Concluding Remarks}

This thesis describes an optimization model for the Fantasy Premier League Decision Problem by suggesting an approach for optimizing Fantasy Premier League decisions. To the author's knowledge, the mathematical model presented is the first of its kind for the Fantasy Premier League. Also, to the best of the author's knowledge, the concept of modelling gamechips have never been considered in Fantasy Sports.

The model has been solved deterministically, with forecasts of player performance used as input. The forecasts are generated by three different methods: the Modified Average method, the Regression method and the Odds method. Moreover, the gamechips are implemented by use of qualitative strategies. The strategies are mostly developed by considering whether a gameweek is blank or double. In addition, risk handling constraints are added and the impact is studied.

Solving for realized points reveals a huge potential of improvement in performance in FPLDP. Even the top manager among 5.9 million users only manages to achieve approximately 50\% of the optimal solution. This speaks in volumes of the nature of uncertainty in the FPLDP. Furthermore, it motivates researching the problem, as the top performing solutions are far from optimal. For the forecast-based optimization model we have developed, achieving a position among the top 30\% of all managers appears obtainable by all marks. Moreover, forecasts based either on the Regression or Modified Average method are deemed most promising. For these methods, a top 10\% finish appears top be within reach. 


\newpar

The effect of adding risk handling constraints related to variance has also been analyzed. The results are promising, and indicates that a strategy that considers which players face each other in a gameweek can either be used to limit variance or boost performance, depending on the threshold set. Obtaining both effects simultaneously, however, appears to be impossible. In the best cases, the model reaches approximately the top 1.5\% of managers when risk handling is introduced alongside forecasts from the Modified Average method. Winning the Fantasy Premier League, i.e. finishing as the top manger, appears to be unachievable with the methods suggested in this thesis.

\newpar

Even though the results are promising, there exist some drawbacks worth addressing. Most notably, the implementation of the gamechips is unsatisfactory in the sense that with forecasts from the Modified Average and Odds method, the performances are aggravated when gamechips are introduced. Another drawback is the sparsity of data. As data for only two seasons are available, the results must be interpreted carefully. Because of the limitation of data and its constraints, it would be interesting to use the data of 2017/2018 season to enhance the solution framework presented in this thesis in order to see if it yields higher performance for next year's Fantasy Premier League.

\newpar

As 5.9 million managers compete in the Fantasy Premier League, competition is fierce. In fact, a mean of only 1.9 points per gameweek separates a top 10\% finish from a top 20\% finish in 2017/2018 season. The growing attention from commercial actors and the monetary figures seen in other Fantasy Sports, such as in Daily NFL Fantasy Sports, indicate that improving average performance by only a small amount may be of huge monetary value in the future. Thus, further development of the forecast-based optimization model, as well as more research on the FPLDP in general,  has great potential value.
