Fantasy Premier League is an online game where participants assemble imaginary teams consisting of real players within the English Premier League. Participants gain points based on the players' performances week-by-week in real-life Premier League matches. In this thesis, a mathematical model describing Fantasy Premier League is developed. Moreover, a forecast-based optimization model is developed in order to make manager decisions in Fantasy Premier League. Contrary to other Fantasy Sports, Fantasy Premier League contains gamechips which can be used in order to improve the performances in particular gameweeks. These gamechips are modeled in the mathematical model.

The mathematical model has been solved by use of a rolling horizon heuristic with forecasts of player points as input. Three forecasting methods are developed in order to generate forecasts. The first approach is centered around the average points obtained by player. The second approach is based on regression on multiple explanatory variables. The third and last approach utilizes bookmakers' odds in order to predict points, combining team odds and individual player odds. In order to obtain data for the last approach, we have cooperated with Sportradar, a Norwegian company providing odds for international bookmakers. The mathematical model developed is also solved with realized points in order to obtain the optimal solution. 

\newpar 

Strategies for the implementation of gamechips are developed and their impact is tested. Furthermore, the effect of adding risk handling constraints has been analyzed. It is tested whether there exists a trade-off between risk and reward, similar to that found in portfolio optimization.

\newpar

The model has been run for the first 35 gameweeks of the 2017/2018 Fantasy Premier League season, and the results are compared to the performance of Fantasy Premier League managers. The last part of the thesis is dedicated to discussion of further research in order to improve the performance of the model.
