\noindent Fantasy Premier League is an online game where participants assemble imaginary teams consisting of real players within the English Premier League. Participants gain points based on the player performances in week-by-week real-life Premier League matches. This thesis applies an optimization model in order to make manager decisions in Fantasy Premier League.

\newpar 

The model maximizes the expected points gained by the Premier League players in order to select players for the team. Three variations of forecasts are developed in order to generate expected Fantasy points for the season 2017/2018. The first approach considers the previous average fantasy points in order to provide a prediction for the upcoming rounds. The second approach is based on linear regression. The last approach utilizes bookmakers' odds in order to predict the future player performances, combining results odds and individual players odds. The last approach is done with cooperation with Sportradar, a Norwegian company providing odds probabilities for international bookmakers. The research in this thesis is based on data from Premier League seasons 2016/2017 and 2017/2018.

\newpar

The model has been run for the first 35 gameweeks of this year's Fantasy Premier League season, and the results are compared to the performance of Fantasy Premier League managers. The last part of the thesis is dedicated to discussion of further research in order to improve the performance of the model.  

 
The model has been solved in a rolling horizon fashion, where each sub-problem considers decisions for a given number of gameweeks. Hence, it attempts to maximize the performance for each sub-problem. As new information is available ahead of each gameweek, the model accounts for what happened in previous gameweeks when making decisions. Contrary to other Fantasy Sports, Fantasy Premier League contains gamechips which can be used in order to improve the performances in particular gameweeks. These gamechips are considered in our optimization model.

\newpar

The uncertainty in this problem lies in the expected points gained. The model has been solved deterministically by use of expected points. Forecasts are generated in three different ways. The first approach consists of weighting the average of previous performances. Another approach generates forecasts through linear regression of important FPL variables. The last approach utilizes bookmakers' odds to obtain forecasts of player performances.
