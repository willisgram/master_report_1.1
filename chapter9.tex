\chapter{Recommendations for Further Research}

Firstly, a potential for future research exists by the fact that more data will be available in the future. Thus, procedures such as a parameter tuning with the regression is possible. Furthermore, a parameter tuning with gemachips or variance is an interesting topic.

With respect to forecasts, one suggestion is to join methods. In particular since the Odds method performs best in the beginning of the season. Furher, one could use odds as a explanatory variable in the optimization model.

With respect to the gamechips, in particular the Wildcard can benefit from another form of implementation.

Others may wish to consider entirely different models such as a stochastic optimization or a method based on machine learning.
